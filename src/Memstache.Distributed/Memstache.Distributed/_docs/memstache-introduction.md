# Introduction to MemStache.Distributed

MemStache.Distributed is a high-performance, feature-rich distributed caching library for .NET applications. It provides a robust and secure solution for managing distributed caches, offering seamless integration with popular technologies and a focus on developer productivity.

## Purpose

The primary goal of MemStache.Distributed is to simplify the implementation of distributed caching in .NET applications while providing advanced features such as encryption, compression, and flexible key management. It aims to enhance application performance, scalability, and security by offering an efficient and easy-to-use caching solution.

## Key Features

1. **Distributed Caching**: Leverages Redis as the underlying distributed cache provider, enabling high-performance data storage and retrieval across multiple application instances.

2. **Secure Key Management**: 
   - Integrates with Azure Key Vault for secure key storage and management in production environments.
   - Supports the Rebel Alliance KeyVault Secrets Emulator for local development and testing, ensuring a consistent experience across all stages of development.

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Built-in encryption capabilities to secure sensitive cached data.
   - Compression support to optimize storage and network usage.

4. **Flexible Serialization**: Supports various serialization options, with System.Text.Json as the default serializer.

5. **Multi-tenancy Support**: Enables efficient cache isolation for multi-tenant applications.

6. **Eviction Policies**: Implements multiple cache eviction strategies, including LRU (Least Recently Used), LFU (Least Frequently Used), and time-based policies.

7. **Performance Optimizations**: Includes features like batch operations and memory-efficient byte array pooling to enhance performance.

8. **Resilience and Error Handling**: Implements circuit breaker and retry policies to handle transient failures gracefully.

9. **Telemetry and Logging**: Integrates with popular logging and monitoring solutions for better observability.

10. **Extensibility**: Designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for custom implementations of various components.
