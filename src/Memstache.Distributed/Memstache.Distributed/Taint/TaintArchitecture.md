# MemStache Roots-of-Trust and Taint Signatures

## Software Specification

### 1. Overview

The Roots-of-Trust and Taint Signatures feature for MemStache.Distributed is designed to enhance security, provenance tracking, and environmental awareness across the enterprise. This system extends from hardware to software, providing a robust framework for ensuring data integrity, security, and appropriate usage.

### 2. Key Concepts

2.1 Two-Dimensional Provenance
   - Tracks security levels and agency context (organizational provenance) of data
   - Implemented in TaintStash wrapper

2.2 Root-of-Trust Compilation
   - Generates base binary libraries containing:
     a) Information about specific hardware present when compiled
     b) Runtime rules for downstream binaries
     c) Agency context (provenance) information
   - Implemented through CompilationTargetProfile class

2.3 Taint Signatures
   - Software-expressed roots of trust
   - Include hardware and software traits discoverable within a runtime environment
   - Implemented through TaintSignature class

2.4 Non-Destructive Coalescence of Objects
   - Allows creating complex data combinations from simpler structures
   - Enables decomposition of structures back into simpler components
   - Preserves fidelity of taint signatures and security when mixing data from different security levels and organizational contexts
   - Implemented in TaintStash wrapper methods

2.5 Compilation Target Profile
   - Defines the runtime target (hardware or software)
   - Enables compiler and application runtime to identify and verify the correct execution environment
   - Implemented through CompilationTargetProfile class

2.6 Tight Coupling
   - Ensures compiled software only runs when all traits in the Compiler Target Profile are verified
   - Implemented through runtime verification in TaintMemStacheDistributed

### 3. System Architecture

The system is implemented through a set of interconnected classes, each responsible for a specific aspect of the Roots-of-Trust and Taint Signatures concept.

## Implemented Classes

### 1. TaintStash<T>

A wrapper for the existing Stash<T> class, adding taint-specific properties and methods.

Key features:
- Wraps a Stash<T> object
- Includes TwoDimensionalProvenance, TaintSignature, and CompilationTargetProfile properties
- Provides methods for coalescence and decomposition
- Verifies environmental constraints

### 2. HDKeyManager

Manages the creation and derivation of Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) keys.

Key features:
- Creates master keys (Level 5)
- Derives lower-level keys
- Retrieves keys by level or ID

### 3. TaintSignature

Represents and manipulates taint signatures.

Key features:
- Stores hardware traits, software traits, and environmental constraints
- Generates and verifies signatures
- Combines signatures for coalescence

### 4. CompilationTargetProfile

Defines and verifies runtime targets.

Key features:
- Stores hardware and software requirements
- Generates profiles based on the current environment
- Verifies if the current environment matches the profile

### 5. TwoDimensionalProvenance

Encapsulates the concept of two-dimensional provenance.

Key features:
- Stores security level and agency context
- Provides methods for combining provenance information
- Allows addition of arbitrary metadata

### 6. TaintCryptoService

Extends the existing CryptoService with taint-specific functionality.

Key features:
- Encrypts and decrypts data with taint signatures
- Signs and verifies data with taint signatures
- Integrates with the HDKeyManager for key operations

### 7. TaintKeyManagementService

Provides HD key management functionality with taint signatures.

Key features:
- Generates master and derived keys with associated taint signatures
- Retrieves keys and their taint signatures
- Verifies and updates taint signatures for keys

### 8. TaintMemStacheDistributed

Wraps the existing MemStacheDistributed class, adding taint-specific logic.

Key features:
- Stores and retrieves TaintStash objects
- Encrypts and signs data with taint signatures before storage
- Verifies taint signatures and environmental constraints upon retrieval

### 9. ITaintProvider

An interface defining taint-related operations.

Key features:
- Defines methods for generating, verifying, and combining taint signatures
- Includes operations for encrypting and decrypting data with taint signatures
- Provides methods for managing compilation target profiles

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a comprehensive framework for implementing the Roots-of-Trust and Taint Signatures concept in the MemStache.Distributed library. It significantly enhances the security and provenance tracking capabilities of the system while maintaining compatibility with the existing API.

The new classes work together to ensure that all data stored in the distributed cache is properly signed, encrypted, and associated with taint signatures and compilation target profiles. This allows for fine-grained control over data access based on security levels, organizational context, and environmental constraints.

Future work may include implementing additional security features, optimizing performance, and extending the system to support more complex scenarios of data sharing and access control.
